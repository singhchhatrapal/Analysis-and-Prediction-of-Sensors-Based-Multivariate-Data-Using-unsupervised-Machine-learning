This study focuses on assessing the quality of groundnut oil, a crucial parameter in the 
oil industry, by predicting its fatty acid content through multi-sensor signal analysis. 
Traditionally, assessing fatty acid content involves costly and complex methods like 
GC-MS and HPLC, which are unsuitable for routine analysis in continuous production 
lines due to their expense, need for skilled operators, and time-consuming nature. To 
address this, the study develops a customized multi-sensor instrument utilizing 
pattern analysis to test groundnut oil fatty acid content. By employing 8 MOS sensors 
selected through rigorous procedures, the instrument detects common chemical 
components in groundnut oil. The sensor array generates signature patterns 
representing the oil's odor, facilitating fatty acid content prediction. Multivariate Data 
Analysis, specifically probability neural network, processes the multi-sensor data for 
accurate prediction.
